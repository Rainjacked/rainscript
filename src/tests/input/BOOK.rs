  Me: "It's like an interactive book that you can read on\n
  \t\t\ta computer or a console."

  Sylvie: "Interactive?"
  Me: "You can make choices that lead to different events and endings in the story."
  Sylvie: "So where does the \"visual\" part come in?"
  Me: "Visual novels have pictures and even music, sound effects, and sometimes voice acting to go along with the text."

  @show Sylvie(smile)

  Sylvie: "I see! That certainly sounds like fun. I actually used to make webcomics way back when, so I've got lots of story ideas."
  Me: "That's great! So...would you be interested in working with me as an artist?"
  Sylvie: "I'd love to!"
