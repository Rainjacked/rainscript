  "We take turns coming up with stories and characters and support each other to make some great games!"
  "And one day..."

  Sylvie: "Hey..."
  Me: "Yes?"

  // from this point on, Sylvie will have text color blue

  Sylvie: "Will you marry me?"
  Me: "What? Where did this come from?"

  @show Sylvie(surprised)

  Sylvie: "Come on, how long have we been dating?"
  Me: "A while..."

  @show Sylvie(smile)

  Sylvie: "These last few years we've been making visual novels together, spending time together, helping each other..."
  Sylvie: "I've gotten to know you and care about you better than anyone else. And I think the same goes for you, right?"
  Me: "Sylvie..."

  @show Sylvie(giggle)

  Sylvie: "But I know you're the indecisive type. If I held back, who knows when you'd propose?"

  @show Sylvie(normal)

  Sylvie: "So will you marry me?"
  Me: "Of course I will! I've actually been meaning to propose, honest!"
  Sylvie: "I know, I know."
  Me: "I guess... I was too worried about timing. I wanted to ask the right question at the right time."

  @show Sylvie(giggle)

  Sylvie: "You worry too much. If only this were a visual novel and I could pick an option to give you more courage!"

  @show @dissolve @bg color(black)

  "We get married shortly after that."
  "Our visual novel duo lives on even after we're married...and I try my best to be more decisive."
  "Together, we live happily ever after even now."
  "**Good Ending**."
